            When something is non-serializable, it means it cannot be easily converted into such a format. 
            This is often because it contains data types or structures that donâ€™t have a straightforward representation as a simple string or number. 
            Common examples of non-serializable items in JavaScript include:

Functions: Functions cannot be serialized because their internal state and execution context are lost when converted to a string.
Promises: Promises represent future values and their state (pending, fulfilled, or rejected) cannot be serialized.
Symbols: Symbols are unique and cannot be represented in a serialized format.
DOM elements: DOM elements represent parts of the document and cannot be serialized as simple data.
Class instances: Instances of custom classes might have methods and internal state that cannot be easily serialized.
